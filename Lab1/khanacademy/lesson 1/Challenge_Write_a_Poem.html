    <h1>Potato chips</h1>
    <p>Golden, salty, oh so crisp,<br>
    In my hand, a crunchy wisp!<br>
    Brother's gone, the house is mine,<br>
    Cola, chips, a perfect sign!<br>
    Poteto chippu, yum, yum, yum,<br>
    Games are on, my kingdom come!<br>
    One more bag, then maybe two,<br>
    This is bliss, for little Umaru! </p>
